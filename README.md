# ⚡ Data Cleaning & Analysis Practice

This repository contains a practice project focused on **data cleaning** and basic **data analysis** using Python.  
The goal of this exercise was to transform a raw, messy dataset into a structured and analyzable form, and then extract a few meaningful insights.

## 🧠 What I Did
- Removed missing or duplicate values  
- Standardized and formatted inconsistent data  
- Converted data types where necessary  
- Performed basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Visualized relationships between key features using `matplotlib`  
- **Provided comments alongside each analysis step** to explain observations and insights
- ## New Update (October 2025)
- Added PCA analysis (02_pca_analysis.ipynb)
- Updated folder structure (data + notebooks)
- Cleaned dataset remains available for analysis

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**

---

## 📊 Sample Insights
- Price distributions and correlations with other features  
- Relationships between numerical and categorical data  
- Basic trend observations from visualized plots  
- **All plots and analyses are accompanied by comments for clarity**

## 🎯 Purpose
This mini project was created as part of my data cleaning and visualization learning practice.  
It focuses on developing a clean workflow from raw data to insight-ready results.
